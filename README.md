## About The Project

As part of the project, we combined the knowledge we learned as part of the cyber course, together with the principles of a development language as we learned to develop a web-based information system and a relational database.

This is a development for an imaginary communication company called Comunication_LTD, this company markets Internet browsing packages and in its database you can find, among other things, information about the company's customers, the various browsing packages and the sectors to which it markets its products.
